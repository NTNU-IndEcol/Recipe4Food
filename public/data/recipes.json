If the sugar has trouble distributing evenly, it’s OK to use a spatula to spread it. But you shouldn’t stir the sugar too much, which will cause crystallization. Observe the sugar carefully when the color starts to turn pale yellow. You might need to lower the heat if a portion of the sugar is turning color too fast and the rest of the sugar has not dissolved yet. When most of the sugar turns golden, carefully add the ribs to the wok. Stir constantly to coat the ribs well with melted sugar. Stir until the ribs turn golden brown, then turn off the heat."

Continue to cook, flipping regularly, until both sides are crisp and browned, about 3 minutes. Turn to medium-low heat if the pan gets too hot. Transfer the pancake to a cooling rack or a cutting board to cool. Repeat to cook all the pancakes you plan to serve."
